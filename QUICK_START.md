# üåô Nightreign Quick Start Guide

## What is This?
Lorebooks for **Elden Ring Nightreign** - the standalone co-op roguelike game. These are specifically for Nightreign's unique mechanics and should NOT be mixed with base Elden Ring lorebooks.

## Step 1: Choose Your Setup

### üéØ For Expedition Roleplay
Load these 3:
- `nightreign_characters.json` (Nightfarers)
- `nightreign_bosses_enemies.json` (Nightlords)
- `nightreign_mechanics.json` (Game systems)

### üë• For Character Focus
Load these 3:
- `nightreign_characters.json`
- `nightreign_items.json` 
- `nightreign_locations.json`

### ‚öîÔ∏è For Boss Encounters
Load these 2:
- `nightreign_bosses_enemies.json`
- `nightreign_mechanics.json`

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Complete File (Not Recommended)
- `nightreign_master_complete.json` - ALL content (high token usage!)

## Step 2: Import to SillyTavern

1. Download your chosen files from `/lorebooks`
2. Open SillyTavern ‚Üí World Info
3. Click Import ‚Üí Select files
4. Done! ‚ú®

## Step 3: Settings

Configure in World Info:
```
Search Depth: 3-4
Token Budget: 600-800 per file
Recursive Scanning: ON
Case Sensitive: OFF
```

## Important Differences from Base Game

### This is Nightreign, NOT Elden Ring:
- **3-player co-op** focus (not solo)
- **Roguelike** mechanics (not souls-like)
- **Nightfarers** (not Tarnished)
- **Limveld** setting (not full Lands Between)
- **Three-day expeditions** (not open exploration)
- **Night's Tide** shrinking map (not static world)

### Don't Mix With Base Game
Nightreign uses different:
- Combat mechanics
- Character systems  
- Boss behaviors
- Map structure

Keep these lorebooks SEPARATE from main Elden Ring files!

## üìä File Reference

| File | Entries | Best For |
|------|---------|----------|
| characters | 16 | Nightfarer RP |
| bosses | 17 | Boss fights |
| mechanics | 14 | Game systems |
| locations | 10 | Exploration |
| items | 11 | Equipment |

## üí° Pro Tips

- **Switch files** when context changes
- **Never load all files** at once
- **Focus on expedition phase** you're roleplaying
- **Remember the time limit** - expeditions are fast!

## Common Scenarios

### "Starting an Expedition"
Load: characters + mechanics

### "Facing a Nightlord"
